Description: The DMDBSCAN Algorithm is a dynamic method for discovering density varied clusters. Implementation of this function is proposed by Elbatta (2012). This algorithm is able to determine the Epsilon Optimal Value (Eps) on DBSCAN Algorithm. Users only need to input the data to be used and the K value which will be the minimum point value (minPts). Then this function will look for the optimal epsilon point according to the data distribution and will produce a cluster that is formed.
